# Schedulebot

# Primary goals
* Enable better tracking and analysis of tasks, completion and time spent
* Create single workflow for tasks that avoids data replication where unnecessary
* Automatic filtering to highlight tasks to be done each day with an eye toward enabling more work to be done and reducing task overload

# Tracking and Analysis

## Todoist Events to BigQuery

## BigQuery to DBT

# Task Workflow

## Primary

### Todoist Tasks to Focused Task Function to Obsidian daily note

### Calendar to Work time estimate to Focused Task Function

## Secondary

### Tasks from git repositories
### Shared tasks to google keep
### Allow for useful Obsidian interactivity
- Edit task schedule on some sort of calendar or agenda
# Highlight Tasks

# MVP rational
1. Get currently due tasks
2. Take current number of poms
3. In order of priority, fill time for today.
4. Snooze everything else non-short break

# Secondary Goals

## Implement necessary authorization flows to generalize for other users

## For exploratory reasons, use docker alternatives
